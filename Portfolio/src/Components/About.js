      <div><p>Hey there, my name is Shreya!</p>
      <p>This is my portfolio, more like, something that represents me online!<br/>For some of you, probably this is the only way we are going to interact, so I want you to know me, not the face, not the college, or anything, the person!<br/><br/> </p>
      <p>When I was kid, I used to sit all day and craft cool stuff or draw robots. I remember how I managed to create small parts that if added together would make a beautiful Underwater Scenary. I also created a Treasure Box to put in that scenary. I created a Rocket and designed a super Helmet that'd turn me a super girl. And even as a school project I created a hemispherical part of Moon, a rocket from thermocol and card board and made Neil Armstrong, along with his 2 crewmates and green aliens out of clay. LOL! <br/><br/>I used to think that one day, the things I draw would turn into reality or one day I'd be able to build robots and all the things I create from paper & card board.
 Don't know when all this turned into *which college has the highest placement rates* or *what company gives the highest package* race. But here, I am trying to go in that deep sleep again, I am trying to enjoy everything as if all this is a beautiful dream, and thus I enjoy every project, assignment, job, or anything that I get to do. Unlike everyone else, I really want to be happy all the time. <br/><br/>Thanks for reading my chatter!<br/>~Shreya
